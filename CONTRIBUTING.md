## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Inner Ink Code of Conduct](https://github.com/knownasnaffy/inner-inkblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior
to [naffydharni006@gmail.com](mailto:naffydharni006@gmail.com).

## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available [Documentation]().

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/knownasnaffy/inner-ink/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

-   Open an [Issue](https://github.com/knownasnaffy/inner-ink/issues/new).
-   Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
-   Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

<!--
You might want to create a separate issue tag for questions and include it in this description. People should then tag their issues accordingly.

Depending on how large the project is, you may want to outsource the questioning, e.g. to Stack Overflow or Gitter. You may add additional contact and information possibilities:
- IRC
- Slack
- Gitter
- Stack Overflow tag
- Blog
- FAQ
- Roadmap
- E-Mail List
- Forum
-->

### Reporting Bugs

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-   Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the [documentation](). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
-   To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/knownasnaffy/inner-inkissues?q=label%3Abug).
-   Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
-   Collect information about the bug:
    -   Stack trace (Traceback)
    -   OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
    -   Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
    -   Can you reliably reproduce the issue?

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Read the [Security Policy](https://github.com/knownasnaffy/inner-ink/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for more info.

<!-- You may add a PGP key to allow the messages to be sent encrypted as well. -->

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

-   Open an [Issue](https://github.com/knownasnaffy/inner-ink/issues/new). (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
-   Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
-   Please provide as much context as possible and describe the _reproduction steps_ that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.
-   Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

> **Tip:** Use the [Bug Report]() issue template to make the report easily.

Once it's filed:

-   The project team will label the issue accordingly.
-   A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `status: needs more info`. Bugs with the `status: needs more info` tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.
-   If the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `status: confirmed`, as well as possibly other tags (such as `priority: *`), and the issue will be left to be [implemented by someone](#your-first-code-contribution).

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Inner Ink, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-   Read the [documentation]() carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
-   Perform a [search](https://github.com/knownasnaffy/inner-ink/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
-   Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.

<!-- omit in toc -->

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/knownasnaffy/inner-ink/issues).

-   Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
-   Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
-   **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
-   You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
-   **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Inner Ink users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

<!-- IDEA: You might want to create an issue template for enhancement suggestions that can be used as a guide and that defines the structure of the information to be included. If you do so, reference it here in the description. -->

### Improving The Documentation

Clear and comprehensive documentation is essential for the success and usability of Inner Ink. Contributions to improving our documentation are highly appreciated. Here's how you can contribute:

#### Types of Documentation Contributions

1. **Updating Existing Documentation**: If you come across outdated, incomplete, or unclear sections in the documentation, feel free to update it. Ensure that the changes align with the current features or functionalities.

2. **Creating New Documentation**: If you notice a missing aspect that would benefit from documentation, such as new features or usage guides, you're welcome to create new documentation sections or pages.

#### Guidelines for Documentation Contributions

-   **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in writing style, formatting, and language throughout the documentation.

-   **Clarity and Completeness**: Ensure the documentation is clear, easy to understand, and comprehensive. Aim to cover all essential aspects related to the topic.

-   **Use of Markdown**: Write documentation using Markdown format for text formatting. Provide examples, code snippets, and images where necessary.

-   **Commit format**: Read [commit message format](#commit-message-format) for more info.

8. **Review and Merge:**

    - After creating a pull request, project maintainers will review your changes. Once approved, your code will be merged into the main project.

### Commit Message format

We encourage contributors to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for writing commit messages. This convention helps standardize commit messages and aids in generating changelogs automatically.

When making contributions to Inner Ink, please format your commit messages following the Conventional Commits specification:

-   Use a short, descriptive summary of your changes in the commit message's first line (limited to 72 characters).
-   Separate the summary from the body of the message with a blank line.
-   Provide detailed explanations or additional context in the commit body if necessary.

> **Tip:** Use `pnpm commit` command to run commitizen for formatting commits with ease

Examples:

```
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

```
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Remove timeouts which were used to mitigate the racing issue but are
obsolete now.
